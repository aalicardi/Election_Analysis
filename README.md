## Overview of Election Audit
Tom, an employee for the board of elections in Colorado, is performing an election audit of the tabulated results for a Congressional precinct in Colorado that includes the following counties: Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe. Although we could use excel for the audit, using Python would help automate the process for future audits. 

### Purpose
