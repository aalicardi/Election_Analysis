# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
Tom, an employee for the board of elections in Colorado, is performing an election audit of the tabulated results for a Congressional precinct in Colorado that includes the following counties: Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe. Although we could use excel for the audit, using Python would help automate the process for future audits. 

### Purpose
For this challenge, we are to help Tom with writing a code that analyzes the election vote data and generates a report using python. This report needs to include the follow: 
- total number of votes 
- total number of votes for each candidate
- winning candidate by popular vote
-
## Election Audit Results

**- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?**
**- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.**

**- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.**
**- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?**
